# bamazon
bamazon CLI app

Bamazon javascript file connected to database well enough but I had some issues getting product names and stock quantities to console log properly. See attached 'Welcome page' screenshot.

The app asks the user to select a product to purchase and a quantity.

The update database function didn't work nor did the if/else statement. See attached 'purchase interface' screenshot.
